## Developing with our Plugin

So you want to add support or even develop an addon for our plugin then you can easily add it to your development environment! All releases get uploaded to my
maven repository. (Replace `{version}` with the appropriate version!)

## Setting up a Workspace/Compiling from Source

* Clone: Clone the repository like this: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/AuraDevelopmentTeam/PowerMoney.git`
* IDE-Setup: Run [gradle] in the repository root: `./gradlew installLombok <eclipse|idea>`
* Build: Run [gradle] in the repository root: `./gradlew build`. The build will be in `build/libs`
* If obscure Gradle issues are found try running `./gradlew cleanCache clean`

## Development builds

Between each offical release there are several bleeding edge development builds, which you can also use. But be aware that they might contain unfinished
features and therefore won't work properly.

You can find the builds here: https://gitlab.aura-dev.team/AuraDev/PowerMoney/pipelines

On the right is a download symbol, click that a dropdown will open. Select "build". Then you'll download a zip file containing all artifacts including the
plugin jar.

## Signing

### PGP Signing

All files will be signed with PGP.  
The public key to verify it can be found in `keys/publicKey.asc`. The signatures of the files will also be found in the maven.

### Jar Signing

All jars from all official download sources will be signed. The signature will always have a SHA-1 hash of `2238d4a92d81ab407741a2fdb741cebddfeacba6` and you
are free to verify it.
